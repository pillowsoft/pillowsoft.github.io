#### Show some code!

```javascript
import {x, y} as p from 'point';
const ANSWER = 42;

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(speed, cost) {
    super(speed);

    var c = Symbol('cost');
    this[c] = cost;

    this.intro = `This is a car runs at
      ${speed}.`;
  }
}
```

Pythagoran theorem is $$c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$.

Bayes theorem:

$$$
c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
