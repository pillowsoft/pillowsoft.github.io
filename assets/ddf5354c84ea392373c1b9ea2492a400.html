<p>With the ever increasing speeds of cable internet and the ever increasing price of cable TV, many are looking at “cutting the cord”. The idea is to ditch your cable TV service and get your video via the internet. There are many ways to do it, but here’s the one I use.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need an HDHomeRun for $139 which will connect to your cable. This little box has 2 cable tuners in it, and takes whatever the tuners see and converts them to video that can be stored on your Mac. Note, this only works with unencrypted TV on your cable. If you stop your cable TV service, but keep your cable internet, you’ll still be able to receive the major free channels (i.e. CBS, NBC, etc.). You’ll be able to watch those “live” on any TV in your house, as well as DVR them using the software below.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>EyeTV, a software app for your Mac the works with the HDHomeRun to act as a DVR. That will run you $80.  You’ll also need a TV Guide Subscription which will be used with the EyeTV app to provide scheduling and show information. That will run you about $12 per year. Note, your Mac needs to be on all the time to record the videos, so this only works well with desktop Macs that aren’t being constantly moved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>One or more AppleTV’s. These will allow you to view the material you DVR’d with the HDHomeRun on a TV. They also allow you to watch youtube, NetFlix (if you have a NetFlix account), and many other sources of media.</li>
</ul>

<p>I very rarely watch live TV, so my modus operandi here is to DVR those shows I like off standard network television. I then tell EyeTV that when it’s done recording, it should convert them to AppleTV format and add them to an iTunes playlist. That playlist is visible on my AppleTV and I can watch the video whenever I want. I also subscribe to a number of wonderful free podcasts (TED, The Random Show, etc.). A whole host of wonderful videos are also available on Youtube and Vimeo, both of which are supported natively in the AppleTV.  Many time I like downloading and retaining YouTube and Vimeo videos.  Vimeo allows you to do that by default, but you have to use Google Chrome and a Chrome plugin called FastestTube to download videos off Youtube. It doesn’t always works, but seems to most of the time.</p>
<p>There’s a first stab at notes on how to cut the cord. More to come…</p>
